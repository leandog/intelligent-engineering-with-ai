## GitHub Copilot Tips

- Effective Prompts:

  - Be Descriptive: Use clear and detailed comments to describe the desired functionality.
    - Example: `// Generate a function to sort an array of integers`
  - Provide Examples: Include input and output examples in comments to guide Copilot.
    - Example: `// Example input: [3, 1, 4], Example output: [1, 3, 4]`
  - Iterative Refinement: Start with a basic prompt and refine it based on the suggestions provided by Copilot.

- Common Prompts:
  - Basic Function Generation:
    - Comment: `// Generate a function to reverse a string`
    - Prompt: `function reverseString(input) {`
  - Complex Algorithm:
    - Comment: `// Generate a function to find the longest common subsequence between two strings`
    - Prompt: `function longestCommonSubsequence(str1, str2) {`
  - Data Processing:
    - Comment: `// Generate a function to filter an array of objects based on a property value`
    - Prompt: `function filterByProperty(arr, prop, value) {`
